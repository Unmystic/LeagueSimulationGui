# LeagueSimulationGui
A Gui, using PyQt6 for simple classic sports league simulation.


Using predetermined library of team names (like Ravens, Gorillas, Tornadoes , etc.) and descriptors (Amazing, Marvelous, Glorious, etc.) create a simulation of league tournament. The rules for the tournament are simple:

-- Every team plays with others twice: home and away game.
-- 3 points for the victory , 1 point for the draw.
